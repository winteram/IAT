OVERVIEW:
---------

This is meant to be an easy-to-use implicit association test (see
Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998) for use by interested psychologists.
The input is a basic text file that defines the categories and the stimuli
(or location for the stimuli if they are image files).  The flow of the
test is driven by javascript, and participant responses are stored in a
comma-delimited text file.  At the end of the test, a simple effect size is
calculated to determine the participant's tendency to find two categories
more congruent than the other two categories.


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

Server-side: PHP (with permission to write files in directory)
Client-side: Javascript-enabled web browser


USE:
----

1) copy the folder to a publicly accessible folder on your web server
2) modify the file "IATname.inc":
   a) set the variable $IATname to the name of the IAT (e.g. "Race" if it
      were a Race IAT)
   b) if you are (not) using images as stimuli, change $pictures to "true"
      ("false")
3) modify the file "input.txt":
   - "catA" and "catB" are the target categories, "cat1" and "cat2" are the
     association categories. DO NOT MODIFY THESE LABELS.
   - Each category has 4 components:
       1. "label" is what is displayed to the participant in the
          instructions and during the task
       2. "datalabel" is how the category is identified in the output
       3. "itemtype" can be either "txt" or "img"
       4. "items" are either the words to be displayed (if "itemtype" is
          "txt") or the location of the image file to display (if "itemtype"
          is "img")
   - Make sure everything is surrounded by double quotes!
4) Modify "writeFile.php": set the variable $base_dir to the directory
   where you would like to keep the output
5) Direct your browser to http://yourserver.com/implicitassoc/trunk/

    pages, listening to user responses, and recording the user responses

IAT.php 
  - This is the main page that contains the frame in which the stimuli and
    instructions appear

IATname.inc 
  - This defines the name of the IAT (e.g., "Race IAT") presented in the
    instructions

index.php
