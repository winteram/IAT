OVERVIEW:
---------

This is meant to be an easy-to-use implicit association test (see
Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998) for use by interested
psychologists. The flow of the test is driven by javascript, and
participant responses are stored in a comma-delimited text file.  At the
end of the test, a simple effect size is calculated to determine the
participant's tendency to find two categories more congruent than the other
two categories.

To create and modify versions of the IAT, and to make them available to
participants, the experimenter can direct their browser to the
"experimenter.php" file.


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

Server-side: PHP (with permission to write files in directory)
Client-side: Javascript-enabled web browser


USE:
----

1) copy the folder to a publicly accessible folder on your web server

2) create a new version of the IAT using the experimenter tool (Direct your
   browser to [yourserver.com]/IAT/experimenter.php)

3) [only necessary if IAT uses images] After creating the template, upload
   the images to the folder "IAT/[template name]/img"

4) Direct participants to your IAT! (e.g., [yourserver.com]/IAT)


OUTPUT:
-------

The output files are in the "output" folder within the template folder for the active IAT.  
The columns are as follows:

Trial #
Round #
Category Label
Category Index (which item within the category)
Errors
Reaction Time (in milliseconds)

CHANGES IN THIS FORK BY TS:
---------------------------

The first page is reduced to just the button; the subject ID field is still there but hidden.
The subject ID is filled from the search property of the location, specified like this:
http://www.server.com/IAT/index.php?subID=12345
subID value can be alphanumeric
subID is case sensitive, ie subid does not work
if no query is present, or if subID is empty (e.g., ?subID= ), subID defaults to 999+random string

After the final screen, the browser automatically navigates to a new location.
This new location is specified in a property in the input.txt of your template 
Note that I did not change the template editor yet, so you have to put this in by hand
The property to add there is "nextURL":"http://xxx.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=...&subID="
The participant ID is then appended to this, so it can be easily used in Qualtrics with an embedded data field called subID
e.g.: {"name":"shorttest","showResult":"noshow","IATtype":"two","nextURL":"http://oslopsych.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_5ndq0H0yAzLKYx7&subID=",...
